 ## MetaMask: The OG EVM Wallet

**Summary:** MetaMask is a popular browser extension and mobile app that functions as a cryptocurrency wallet, providing access to a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain and other networks[3]. It allows users to manage their digital assets, conduct transactions, and interact with Web3 services seamlessly[4].

**Overview:** MetaMask serves as a bridge between traditional web browsers and the decentralized web, enabling users to explore and interact with blockchain-based applications[4]. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing digital identities, signing transactions, and accessing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, NFT marketplaces, and other Web3 services. MetaMask's popularity stems from its ease of use, broad compatibility, and extensive feature set, making it a central tool for navigating the Web3 ecosystem [2, 4].

**Security Model:** MetaMask employs several security measures to protect user data and assets[1]. These include:

*   **Private Key Encryption:** MetaMask encrypts users' private keys and stores them locally on their devices, ensuring that only the user has access to their funds[3].
*   **Hardware Wallet Support:** MetaMask supports integration with hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor, providing an extra layer of security by keeping private keys offline[1].
*   **Transaction Signing:** MetaMask requires users to manually approve all transactions before they are broadcast to the blockchain, preventing unauthorized access to funds[1].
*   **Seed Phrase Backup:** MetaMask provides users with a seed phrase (a set of 12 words) that can be used to recover their wallet in case of device loss or corruption[1].
*   **Avoiding Risky Behavior:** MetaMask provides warnings and resources to educate users about common scams and phishing attacks[1].

**Recent Developments & Unique Features:**
MetaMask continuously evolves, with frequent updates and new features. Recent developments include:

*   **Snaps:** MetaMask Snaps is an innovation that allows developers to build and integrate new features directly into MetaMask, expanding its functionality and customization options[1].
*   **Portfolio DApp:** MetaMask has a portfolio DApp to view tokens, balances, and activity across different networks[1].
